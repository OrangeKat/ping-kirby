<p>Welcome to Kirby&#39;s first tutorial!</p>
<h3 id="lesson-structure">Lesson structure</h3>
<p>Lessons are made of a tutorial, and an exercise, where you will complete code and test it.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-features">Lesson features</h3>
<p>You can save your work using the &quot;Save&quot; button if you want to take a break and return later, or use the &quot;Restore&quot; button to undo all of your work and go back to the original state of the exercise.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>This time, no need to code, just click on the green &quot;Run&quot; button to run your program. It should print &quot;Hello Kirby!&quot; on the terminal output.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-jump-in-the-details-">Let&#39;s jump in the details!</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s go over this code line by line:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Main</span> </span>{
</code></pre>
<p>Line 1: This line declares a public class named Main. This is not important for now, we will talk about classes and objects later.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> </span>{
</code></pre>
<p>Line 2: This line declares a function, and not any function, the main function! This is the entry point of a Java program. We will see what these keyword mean in the next lesson.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello Kirby!"</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Line 3: System is a pre-defined class provided by Java, containing some useful methods. out is a static variable within System that represents the output of your program; println is a method of out that can be used to print a line: here, we are printing &quot;Hello Kirby!&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="and-now-">And now?</h3>
<p>Once you&#39;re done, click on the arrow to go to the next tutorial.</p>
